## The Running Channel

I've loved their YouTube channel ever since I discovered it during COVID.
When they started podcasting, I immediately fell in love with the format.
It's approximately 40 minutes with them talking about their last week of running, talking about a specific topic, going over the news, and ending with listener's questions.
For me, it's the perfect listen on my easy runs.

## Critical Role

I've listened to campaign 2 of Critical Role during COVID and my first marathon training.
While the episodes are definitely bulky, they were the perfect filler for my long runs and helped me with hearing a more theatrical playstyle of Dungeons&Dragons.
I've mainly listened to it on 1.25x speed and during the fights, I bumped it up to 1.5x speed.
The first 19 episodes of campaign 2 can be found here:

While everything after that can be found here:

## Dungeons & Daddies

While Critical Role was a more serious listen, Dungeons & Daddies is the complete opposite.
Don't expect them to follow the rules of D&D perfectly but you can expect a lot of "that sounds cool, let's try it!".
Be warned, I've had to pause my runs multiple times while listening to this podcast as I got troubles breathing from all the laughing.

## Hello from the Magic Tavern

Hello from the Magic Tavern is another D&D podcast that is not as serious of a listen.
The host fell through a dimensional portal behind a Burger King into the fantastical land of Foon.
He uploads a weekly podcast from the tavern the Vermilion Minotaur where he interviews wizards, monsters and adventurers.
It's a great way to learn about all kinds of D&D lore and can give a lot of inspiration for your next adventures.

## I Spent a Day With...

This is the podcast version of Anthony Padilla's YouTube series where each episode he interviews someone or a group of people that are often misunderstood or misrepresented in media.
This can be more of a serious listen but it's also not too heavy on the matter of subjects.

## My Dad Wrote a Porno

Join Jamie with his friends Alice and James as they read the porno that Jamie's dad has written.
Don't expect some high quality literature be read out but that's what makes this podcast so hilarious.
They dissect every weird word choice, mistake and plot inconsistency with classic British wit.
