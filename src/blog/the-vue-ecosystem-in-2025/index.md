## Core Libraries & Tools

These are the bread and butter of almost every Vue project.
By combining Vue Router, Pinia and Vite, you have the basis for a solid project that can easily scale.

| Library                                 | Description                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) | Official router for Vue, essential for SPAs with client-side routing.                                               |
| [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)       | Recommended state management, simpler API than Vuex, better TypeScript support.                                        |
| [Vite](https://vite.dev/)               | Default build tool, fast cold starts and instant hot module replacement resulting in a fantastic Developer Experience. |

## UI Component Libraries

With a UI component library, you save development time, ensure UI consistency, and access pre-built, tested, and accessible components instead of building everything from scratch.
Vuetify is a solid first choice for Vue projects because it provides a comprehensive, Material Design-compliant, accessible, and highly customizable component library with strong TypeScript support, active community backing, and enterprise-ready features.
This makes it ideal for both rapid development and scalable applications.
But be aware of the bloated code that you might be importing.


| Library                                   | Description                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/)         | Material Design components, expanded themes, TypeScript support.      |
| [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/)             | Multi-platform (SPA, PWA, mobile, desktop), comprehensive components. |
| [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/)         | 80+ UI components, data tables, calendars, charts.                    |
| [Element Plus](https://element-plus.org/) | Enterprise-focused, successor to Element UI, Vue 3 optimized.         |
| [Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com/)      | Modern, clean, customizable components.                               |
| [Buefy](https://buefy.org/)               | Lightweight, based on Bulma, modern and stylish.                      |

## Specialized Libraries

Especially VueUse is an interesting library to add to your project as it includes [hundreds of helper composables and helper functions](https://vueuse.org/functions.html) that are commonly used in a Vue project.

| Library                                 | Description                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/)           | Collection of essential Vue Composition Utilities.  |
| [Radix Vue](https://www.radix-vue.com/) | Headless, accessibility-first component primitives. |
| [Vue Chartjs](https://vue-chartjs.org/) | Data visualization with Chart.js integration.       |

## State Management & Utilities

These are some honorable mentions as it's mostly older applications that will still use Vuex for their state management and Axios for making API requests.
A lot of people are now looking at Pinia and the Fetch API that is now supported by browsers so that you don't even need a separate library.

| Library                                    | Description                                         | Alternative                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)            | Legacy state management, largely replaced by Pinia. | [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)                                       |
| [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) | HTTP client for making API requests.                | [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) |

## Testing & Development

The combination of Vitest with Vue testing library is a powerful one.
Thanks to vitest, your tests will run extremely fast.
And with Vue Testing Library, you can query the DOM in the same way the user would.
The utilities from Vue Testing Library allow you to find elements by their label text, finding links and buttons from their text, and assert that your application is accessible.

| Library                                                                            | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)                                                      | Fast unit-testing framework for Vite.                                                                                                 |
| [Vue testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/vue-testing-library/intro/) | Light utility functions on top of `@vue/test-utils`, in a way that encourages better testing practices by using accessible selectors. |
