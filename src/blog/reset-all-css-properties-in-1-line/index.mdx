## The setup: a styled paragraph

As an example, let us look at what a normal paragraph looks like by default on this website.
This code:

```html
<p>A normal paragraph</p>
```

Renders as this:

<hr />

<p>A normal paragraph</p>

<hr />

Now let's assume that we have somewhere a CSS class defined to style a paragraph:

```css
.lots-of-styling {
  color: purple;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: "Comic Sans MS", cursive;
  background-color: lightgreen;
  padding: 15px;
  border: 2px dashed orange;
  margin: 20px;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

Which causes this HTML:

```html
<p class="lots-of-styling">A styled paragraph</p>
```

To render like this:

<p class="lots-of-styling">A styled paragraph</p>

## Revert all stylings

If you want to restyle an element that already has the `.lots-of-styling` class applied (or if all that styling is for example done on the `p` tag itself), then you might end up with having to override a lot of CSS properties.

Thanks to `all: revert` in CSS, we can make this very easy on us.
Let's create a utility class:

```css
.revert-all-styling {
  all: revert;
}
```

So that if we use this HTML:

```html
<p class="lots-of-styling revert-all-styling">
  Paragraph with the styling reverted
</p>
```

We end up with this paragraph:

<p class="lots-of-styling revert-all-styling">
  Paragraph with the styling reverted
</p>

As you can see, we have now returned the styling back to the original `p` styling that is in our site's CSS.

<hr />

## What about 'initial'?

The `all: initial` is a special one to be considered.
`all: revert` resets styles to the browser's default or your site's base styles (whichever applies).
`all: initial` however, forces a complete reset to the CSS specification's default values, ignoring both browser defaults and your site's CSS.
Thus the `all: initial` is an even more powerful tool as it clears up more of the set CSS properties of your elements that you're redefining.

I've created a utility class named `.initial-all-styling`:

```css
.initial-all-styling {
  all: initial;
}
```

And if we apply that on a paragraph:

```html
<p class="lots-of-styling initial-all-styling">After custom styling</p>
<p class="initial-all-styling">Without custom styling</p>
```

We get (added white background div behind it for better clarity):

<div style="background: white">
  <p class="lots-of-styling initial-all-styling">After custom styling</p>
  <br />
  <p class="initial-all-styling">Without custom styling</p>
</div>

## Conclusion

The `all: revert` and `all: initial` CSS statements are very powerful in helping you clean up some previously set styles.
Instead of having to reset everything manually, all styling is reverted or set to the initial properties.
Use `all: revert` when you want to undo styles but respect your site's base design.
Use `all: initial` for a hard reset.
This is helpful when fighting stubborn inherited styles from for example a library.
If your CSS selector has enough specificity, it might help you avoid a lot of uses of `!important`.
