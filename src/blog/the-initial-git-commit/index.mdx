The [first ever git commit](https://github.com/git/git/blob/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290/README) was published on {formatDate("2005-04-08")}.
The creator of git, Linus Torvalds (yes, this is also the one that created the Linux kernel), is known for being very straight forward in his talking in the past.
[He even admitted that himself](https://web.archive.org/web/20151031114409/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/07/passion_of_torvalds):

> I'd like to be a nice person and curse less and encourage people to grow rather than telling them they are idiots. I'm sorryâ€”I tried, it's just not in me.

The first git commit contains a README file that starts off in typical Linus style:

```
	GIT - the stupid content tracker

"git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.

 - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
   mispronounciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
 - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the
   dictionary of slang.
 - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
 - "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

This is a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager.  It
doesn't do a whole lot, but what it _does_ do is track directory
contents efficiently.
```

I love that you can still find this part of the original README in the [current README file](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/README.md).
