Simply create a `settings.json` file in a `.vscode` folder in the root of your repository with these contents:

```
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": false
  }
}
```

What this actually does, is that we disable copilot for all file extensions.
If you still want to have Copilot active for some files, you can enable them after disabling everything.
For example to have it active on Python files:

```
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": false,
    "*.py": true
  }
}
```
