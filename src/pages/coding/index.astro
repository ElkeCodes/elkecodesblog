  <p>
    To sharpen my developer skills, I love to create new things from time to
    time. This is an overview of all kinds of coding projects I've done in the
    past.

          The Pomodoro Focus technique boosts productivity by breaking work into
          focused 25-minute intervals followed by short breaks, helping maintain
          concentration, reduce procrastination, and prevent burnout.
