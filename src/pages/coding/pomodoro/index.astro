  <p>
    The Pomodoro Focus technique is a time management method that boosts
    productivity by breaking work into focused, 25-minute intervals (called
    "Pomodoros"), followed by a 5-minute break; after completing 4 Pomodoros,
    you take a longer 15-30 minute break. This approach helps maintain
    concentration, reduces procrastination, and prevents burnout by encouraging
    short bursts of deep work followed by regular rest. The structured intervals
    create a sense of urgency and accomplishment, making tasks feel more
    manageable while keeping distractions at bay.
