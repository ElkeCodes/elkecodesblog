<!-- Situation: Securex is currently in the process of migrating all of their Mendix applications to React and Java. This
migration to React required additional technical support within the NX monorepo, where all React applications are
housed. This involved implementing new features as well as developing new applications.
Task: The main focus was on developing the React application MyDoc. This is a public application used by
customers, victims, accounting firms, as well as internal staff and the helpdesk at Securex. The purpose of the
application is to look up and visualize documents in a user-friendly interface that functions well on desktop, tablet,
and mobile.
In this application, I took on the role of lead developer: managing other front-end developers, negotiating deadlines,
and actively participating in project analyses.
I also provided support for other applications in the monorepository, assisting with more challenging technical
issues, reviewing pull requests, and contributing to the governance of the monorepository.
Results: The MyDoc application is ready for deployment in production. Other projects are in various stages of
development or are already operational. The team's productivity has increased thanks to the clear agreements I
introduced and the improvements to the NX monorepository configuration. Additionally, the code coverage has
significantly improved, allowing us to better assess the impact of shared code changes. -->
